# Number Guesser

This project was a to create a game between to challengers to correctly guess a chosen random number in the quickest time

## But, why?

This was our first paired project in the first Module at Turing. The purpose is to collaborate with an other developer to implement functionality and create sleek design.

## What are we using?

For our project we are using Javascript for functionality. Within our CSS, we were limited to flex and grid was ruled out. 

## How to play

A player submits a range and then the computer generates a random number within that range. The two competitors then guess numbers and check for hints until they finally reach the correct number. A winner card then appends and outlines the results of the game.
